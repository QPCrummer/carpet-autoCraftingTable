# carpet-autoCraftingTable
autoCraftingTable extension for carpet-mod. Implementation based on Skyrising's implementation for autoCraftingTable for QuickCarpet - implemented here as an extension for fabric-carpet mod.

When enabled, all crafting tables will contain block entites making them immovable. This means that items will also be stored inside the crafting table.


**I recommend my alternate mod over this fork. This one will no longer be getting updates unless absolutely necessary. https://github.com/QPCrummer/FabricAutoCrafter. It contains all these changes and more! The only downside is that it cannot be enabled or disabled as it doesn't use carpet
